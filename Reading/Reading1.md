## Worse is better ###
- software making is better to start with a minimal creation and group it as needed.
### The Rise of Worse is Better
- you must do the right thing according to these characteristics:Simplicity,Correctness,Consistency,Completeness.
- Please make interface simpler than the implementation.(common)
- consistency is as important as correctness.please not be inconsistent.(common)
- design must be more complete.(common)
-  It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface(Worse is better)
- It is slightly better to be simple than correct.(Worse is better)
- Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.(Worse is better)
- Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality.
- PC loser-ing Problem
- A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the programmer is conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and hassle to get good performance and modest resource use.
- The worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. 
- Unix and C use Worse-is-Better. C is easier for user to code the compiler code. 
- big complex system: simplicity is not important,larger and complex,need an excelent hardware.
- diamond-like jewel:takes forever to design
- AI software does not take a worse-is-better approach.
### Worse Better is Worse
- There is two disadvantages of worse-is-better.
- C Interrupt(Worse-is-better)
